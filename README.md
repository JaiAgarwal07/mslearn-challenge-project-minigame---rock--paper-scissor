# mslearn-challenge-project-minigame---rock--paper-scissor
The rock, paper, scissors game is a hand game in which each player chooses one of the three tools. From a programming point of view, this challenge is a nice exercise to practice conditional decisions, iterations, and the use of Python modules.

The winner of the game is based in three simple rules:

Rock beats scissors.
Scissors beat paper.
Paper beats rock.
